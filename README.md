# SketchUp and LayOut API public issue tracker

## For API Users

This repository is a place where you can use it's [issue tracker](https://github.com/SketchUp/api-issue-tracker/issues) to file bug reports and feature requests for the SketchUp and LayOut APIs.

Vote up :+1: existing issues to show your interest in support.

### What this tracker is *not* for

* General SketchUp or LayOut issues should be directed to the [Help Center](https://help.sketchup.com/). Only API issues are accepted in this tracker.
* "How to" questions should be posted in the [forums](https://forums.sketchup.com/c/developers).

## For SketchUp Team

* Weekly we scrub this list.
* We close off-topic issues.
* Each issue is assigned appropriate label to indicate product, API, type of issue (bug, enhancement)
* Bug reports without complete reproducible example will need more information before we log internally.
* Feature requests needs to have context and use-cases before we log internally.
* When we have all information needed we add the label "logged" and comment back with the internal tracker ID.
* When we release a new version of SketchUp we close the reported issues addressed by that release.

See internal document titled "GitHub Issue Tracker Workflow" for more details.
