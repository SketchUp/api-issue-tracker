## For SketchUp Team

* Weekly we scrub this list.
* We close off-topic issues.
* Each issue is assigned appropriate label to indicate product, API, type of issue (bug, enhancement)
* Bug reports without complete reprodusible example will need more information before we log internally.
* Feature requests needs to have context and use-cases before we log internally.
* When we have all information needed we add the label "logged" and comment back with the internal tracker ID.
* When we release a new version of SketchUp we close the reported issues addressed by that release.

See internal document titled "GitHub Issue Tracker Workflow" for more details.
